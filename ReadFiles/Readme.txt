Abstract
This essay is to see how the mission command layers played a significant role in Operation Anaconda. The layers that I will be talking about are competence, mutual trust, shared understanding, commander intent, mission orders, disciplined initiative(Comma) and risk acceptance. Each of these layers helped the U.S. and Afghan forces drive back Al Qaeda and Taliban forces and control of Shahikot Valley. Operation Anaconda would not be a successful mission if they did not utilize mission command. 












Operation Anaconda was the most extensive Afghanistan war on War on Terrorism  after the World Trade Center 11 Sept 2001. On March 2 2002, General Franks and Major General F.L. Hagenbeck, commander of 10th Mountain Division, led the effort to remove al-Qaeda fighters and Taliban allies in the Shahikhot Valley. It was planned to be a three-day battle, but it turned out to be a seven-day battle and terminated after 17 days. With the mission command already set in place at the beginning of the fight. 
Competence
	The first layer of mission command is competence, “Commanders and subordinates achieve the level of competence to perform assigned tasks to standard through training, education, assignment experience, and professional development. Commanders continually assess the competence of their subordinates and their organization.” (ADP 6-0,1  -7). CENTCOM;(; why did you add this?) led by General Franks, directed Operation Anaconda. He had experience in Vietnam War and Gulf War. Plus, General Franks added MG Franklin Hagenbeck to become the U.S. tactical commander in Afghanistan. General Hagenbecks was the commander of the Army’s 10th Mountain Division. Also, SOF (special operations forces) troops and from other countries were alongside Afghan troops. Operation Anaconda had high-quality training of soldiers, Marines and airmen contribute to the fight. At the beginning of the execution phase, soldiers adapted to changing conditions. Physical fitness standards, marksmanship, and small-unit tactics use to prepare better to fight al-Qaeda and Taliban enemies. 

Mutual Trust (don’t have this here it looks bad just put it on the next page unless you have three lines)
	The  second layer of mission command is Mutual Trust. Mutual trust trusts their colleagues who are commanding adjacent and supporting forces, and they must earn their trust as well . (ADP 6-0 1-7) Coalition Land Component Command (CFLCC), Coalition Forces Air Component Command (CFACC) and Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) at first, their mutual trust was difficult. During Operation Anaconda, they learned how to joint network operations with ground and air. Special operation forces (SOF) had a reciprocal relationship with Afghan troops. Afghan troops retreated at the beginning of the operation. March 9, Afghan troops re-entered the battle with mutual trust still intact.   

Shared Understanding
	The third layer of mission command is shared understanding. Shared Understanding is when different branches or units were working together toward a common goal. For example, Operation Anaconda’s mission was to block the enemy’s entrance and exit from the Shahikot Valley. Many other branches were involved with this plan, including Army, Air Force, Marines, (SOF) special operations forces and Afghan troops. The plan failed in the first hours of the battle and adjusted to a different way to complete the mission. With the joint branches forces working together utilizing ground and air support. They both shared understanding and helped each other more than they planned in the beginning.
Commanders Intent
	The fourth layer of mission command is the commander’s intent. Commander’s intent is a clear vision and the end state that supports the purpose of the mission on hand. It also provides their staff and other company commanders what they need to support to accomplish  the task. Whether if the initial plan has failed, they can go a different route and still meet the commander’s intent. For example, General Franks intended to take out the enemy Taliban and al Qaeda forces from Shahikot Valley. General Franks planned was to use “hammer and anvil.” Hammer was to go across Shahikot Valley and destroy the enemy or capture. At the same time, the “Anvil” mission was to block every entry or exit from Shahikot Valley. The Afghan troops departed on the day of the attack and ended the hammer plan. General Franks still manage to create a new plan but (to) still accomplish the commander’s intent.

Mission Orders
	The fifth layer of mission command is mission orders. Mission orders give guidance from all levels, from division to company levels and are standard for issuing Army orders. Commanders provide guidance, resources, task(comma) and authority. Operation Anaconda involved many of moving pieces and authority was a big problem at the beginning of the battle. So many channels had to be pass, to have a green light. That is why during Operation Anaconda, acknowledge why it’s crucial to have an on-scene commander.  Also, a lot of changes of how close air support (CAS), communications with air and ground and Air Force came into the mission plans. For instance, CAS played a significant role cause the ground troops did not have artillery and mortars at their disposal. The initial plan for the Air Force was to drop supplies. But when the battle unfolded, they had to change their mission and cover close air support for the ground forces. Finally, communication plays a significant role in mission orders for Operation Anaconda. I the beginning phase of the battle, ground troops and air troops, FM comms and HF come into effect. Information networks high-speed communication that helped every aspect of the joint force that played in this mission.
Disciplined Initiative
	The sixth layer of mission command is disciplined initiative. The disciplined initiative is existing orders no longer work or when the battle takes a different turn. Commanders will rely on subordinates to act or take action to develop and new situation. But the commander’s intent will always be the same. Operation Anaconda had many changes while the battle began. It started when the Afghan troops left and ended the “hammer and anvil” plan. They had to take a different approach and used ground troops with the help of the Air Force. They were using air support an alternative for not having artillery and mortars. Also, the combination of information networks and precision munitions helps Air Force destroy enemies. How satellite radios were of great importance to ground troops and the bandwidth needed for high volume communication and data from different joints of branches. How General Frank said, the original battle plan did not survive initial contact with the enemy. (Kugler 2007 p.7) 

Risk Acceptance
	The last layer of mission command is risk acceptance. Risk acceptance is what the commanders analyze of the risk and danger of the mission, which means the importance of time, the objective and cost of lives, or equipment cost. Also, commanders encourage subordinate leaders to use their initiative to achieve the commander’s intent and accept risk. General Franks initial plan failed, and his risk acceptance changed also. General Franks had to plan a different strategy to engage the enemy. Therefore, creating a new risk acceptance using CAS (close air support) for the lack of artillery and mortars. Another risk presented itself that General Franks had to manage during Operation Anaconda was midair collisions. Shahibot Valley being only 5 miles long, General Franks and Coalition Forces Air Component Command (CFACC) LTG Paul Mikolashek had to plan to minimize the aircraft coming in and out from the valley. Commanders from different branches went thru many different risk acceptance changes to reduce and complete the task at hand. 
In conclusion, General Franks utilized the mission command layers during Operation Anaconda to remove al-Qaeda fighters and Taliban allies from the Shahikhot Valley. Moreover, Operation Anaconda taught many future commanders the use of mission command layers. Especially the War in Iraq a few years later.
